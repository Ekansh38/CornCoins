        <h2>1. Acknowledgment of Risk</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing the Arcade, you acknowledge that participation in any games or activities within this platform involves significant financial risk. 
            The probability of losing money is higher than the probability of winning. The Arcade is not an investment opportunity, nor is it a financial service. 
            It is purely an entertainment-based feature within Corntopia. 
            You accept full responsibility for any and all losses incurred during your participation.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Win/Loss Probability</h2>
        <p>
            The statistical probability of winning in the Arcade is approximately one in three. This means that for every three spins or rounds played, the system is designed to result in a net loss for two of them. 
            It is not possible to alter or manipulate the odds in any way. 
            Continued participation over time will, on average, result in financial loss.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Finality of Transactions</h2>
        <p>
            All wagers, bets, and financial transactions within the Arcade are final. 
            No refunds, reversals, or chargebacks will be issued under any circumstances. 
            If you lose a wager, you agree that it was a voluntary decision and that you forfeit the wagered amount permanently. 
            Attempts to request reimbursement for losses will be ignored.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Psychological Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            The Arcade uses a randomized probability system that may result in multiple consecutive losses or occasional wins. 
            This system may create an illusion that winning is due after a series of losses. 
            This is known as the "Gambler's Fallacy" and has no basis in statistical reality. 
            No amount of previous losses or wins affects future outcomes. 
            Any perception of "luck" or "hot streaks" is purely coincidental.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Financial Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
            You should only participate in the Arcade if you are prepared to lose the amount you wager. 
            Corntopia and its affiliates bear no liability for financial distress, addiction, or excessive losses caused by your participation. 
            If you are not financially secure, or if you have concerns about potential addiction to gambling-like activities, you should exit this platform immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Prohibited Claims & Disputes</h2>
        <p>
            By proceeding, you agree to waive all rights to dispute or challenge the outcome of any game, wager, or transaction within the Arcade. 
            The system operates using a predetermined algorithm that does not guarantee profit or fairness beyond its programmed probabilities. 
            Any claims suggesting the Arcade is unfair, fraudulent, or malfunctioning will not be entertained.
        </p>

        <h2>7. No Financial Advice</h2>
        <p>
            Participation in the Arcade should not be considered an alternative to any investment, income-generating opportunity, or financial security system. 
            Corntopia does not provide financial, investment, or gambling advice, and participation in this system should not be treated as an attempt to generate revenue.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Agreement to Proceed</h2>
        <p>
            By clicking "Next," you acknowledge that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You accept the risks associated with playing in the Arcade.</li>
            <li>You understand that the odds are against you.</li>
            <li>You accept that all transactions are final and non-refundable.</li>
            <li>You release Corntopia and its affiliates from any liability for losses incurred.</li>
            <li>You waive the right to claim damages, disputes, or financial compensation.</li>
            <li>Your participation is voluntary and not influenced by any misleading promises.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you do not agree with these terms, you must exit immediately. 
            Continuing beyond this page indicates full acceptance of all conditions outlined above.
