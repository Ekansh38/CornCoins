Transform this into a github readme about a project: 

Corntopia was a “country” me and my friends started in school and it slowly grew and evolved. At one point i created a website to manage everyone’s finances and corncoins which was the name of our fake cryptocurrency and credits as our “US dollar”. Before the website everyone part of the nation which at that point was around 8 people kept track of their finances on paper and the price of cryptocurrency was decided by a random person who started it and it was all super messy. Thats the reason I created the website, to manage everyones finances and simulate a real cryptocurrency with a exchange system and supply and demand with the price being the average of the last 3 transactions but the algorithm evolved over time. The cryptocurrency also had a mining system which required your time in exchange for coins, and i did a bunch of research on what made a cryptocurrency valuable and tried implementing all those ideas in corncoins. So corncoins was a full banking website with the ability to transfer funds (credits and corn coins) to other citizens which allowed in people selling things, hiring people and a full economy system. And a cryptocurrency exchange with a mining system. I then went on to add the most important part of corntopia, The Corntopia Peoples Marketplace. Or the marketplace for short. This marketplace allowed citizens to place listens for goods and services in exchange for credits or corn coins, something simmilar to Ebay or carousel. Where you could negotiate prices with the dealer and talk to them and get the item in real life after transferring the money. I also added a full chat system simmilar to google chat or WhatsApp, though my solution was not the best looking back it definitely worked. And this is what grew corntopia, people could sell old toys or random things to earn money to buy other peoples things which they found cool, or pay for a student to help do their homework. This way old toys got a new life, it was sustainable. Corntopia grew to 50+ citizens or users all from in school. Corntopia also got many updates over its few months of being active such as the “arcade” which is just a shadyly rebranded casino. And other random additions. At one point i was considering make a horse racing simulation game which people can bet on horses to gamble money.

This was bound to end….

One day while prepending to work on my english essay while actually working on coding corntopia, my teacher called me into class. 2 snitches had told him everything about corntopia and he told me to shut it down immediately, and it was fraud and it was illegal and all this random jargon which my little brain couldnt handle, so as fast as possible to hide all evidence i deleted the server and the database. Thankfully months later i was able to recover all of the data except the all the images which i am very bumed about.
