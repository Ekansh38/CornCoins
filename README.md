# üåΩ Corntopia  

Corntopia was a digital "country" me and my friends started in school that slowly grew into a full-on economic simulation. What began as a messy paper-based system to track fake money and trades evolved into a complete online banking, cryptocurrency, and marketplace platform ‚Äî powered by **CornCoins**.  

---

## Background  

Before the website, around 8 citizens tracked their finances on paper. The value of CornCoins (our fake cryptocurrency) was arbitrarily decided by whoever started it that day. It was chaotic, inconsistent, and hard to manage.  

To fix this, I built a website to:  
- Manage everyone‚Äôs finances.  
- Simulate a real cryptocurrency system.  
- Enable an internal marketplace for trading goods and services.  
- Create a self-sustaining economy among students.  

Over time, Corntopia grew to **50+ active citizens** in our school.

## Features  

### Banking System  
- Citizens could hold balances in **Credits** (our ‚ÄúUS dollar‚Äù) and **CornCoins** (cryptocurrency).  
- Transfer funds between accounts.  

### Cryptocurrency Exchange  
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Price determined by the average of the last 3 transactions (later refined).  
- **Mining System**: Earn CornCoins in exchange for your time.  
- Implemented ideas from real cryptocurrencies to simulate value creation.  

### Corntopia People‚Äôs Marketplace
- A hub for buying and selling goods and services.  
- Citizens could:  
  - List items like toys, books, or services (e.g. homework help).  
  - Negotiate deals with buyers/sellers.  
  - Complete transactions using Credits or CornCoins.  
- Inspired by **eBay/Carousell**, with real-life delivery after digital payment.  
- Promoted sustainability by giving old toys and items a second life.  

### Chat System
- A messaging feature similar to WhatsApp or Google Chat.  
- Allowed citizens to negotiate deals, chat, and coordinate trades.  

### Fun Extras
- **Arcade** (a.k.a. a rebranded casino).  
- Planned horse racing simulation for betting with CornCoins.  
- Regular updates that kept the community engaged.

## Growth  

Corntopia quickly scaled from **8 to 50+ citizens**.  
- Students were motivated to earn CornCoins/credits by selling things, offering services, or mining.  
- Old toys and random objects gained new value.  
- Citizens created a micro-economy with real social dynamics.

## The Shutdown  

One day, while ‚Äúworking‚Äù on my English essay (actually coding Corntopia), I was called into class. Two students had told the teacher everything about Corntopia.  

I was told to shut it down immediately under accusations of **fraud** and **illegality** ‚Äî jargon that terrified me at the time. In a panic, I deleted the server and database to hide all evidence.  

Luckily, months later, I managed to recover most of the data (except for images, which I‚Äôm still bummed about).

## Legacy  

Although Corntopia was short-lived, it was one of my first large-scale projects:  
- Taught me about **cryptocurrency mechanics**, **economics**, and **community-driven systems**.  
- Helped me practice **Django development**, **databases**, **marketplace logic**, and **chat applications**.  
- Showed how quickly small ideas can scale into a thriving ecosystem when people are engaged.

## Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Final Thoughts  

Corntopia started as a joke between friends but became a surprisingly complex experiment in economics, technology, and community building.  

It was messy, chaotic, and eventually shut down ‚Äî but it remains one of my most memorable projects.
